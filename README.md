Config is a Clojure config file handler.


## Project Goals

## Project Maturity

config is young, but in use at our own projects.


## Artifacts

definition to your `pom.xml`:

``` xml
<repository>
  <id>clojars.org</id>
  <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>
```

## Documentation & Examples

Our documentation site is not yet live, sorry.


Basically, it lets you read a config file to produce a Clojure map.
The config files themselves can contain one or more forms, each of which can be either a map or a list.
Maps are simply merged.
Lists correspond to invocations of extension points, which in turn produces a map, which is merged along with everything else.

A sample config file could look like this (see "/example-resources" in our project)

    (include "config/config.edn")
    (include "config/db.TEST.edn")

    {:env :local
     :another-key {:map true
                   :map-2 42}
     }

As you see, you can include other files.


Read the config using this in your code:

    (gorillalabs.config/init)

to read "config.edn" from the classpath

or

    (gorillalabs.config/init "ENV")

to read "config@ENV.edn" from the classpath.

If you do not want to store your config on the classpath, just include a reference to a specific file in your config.edn file like this

        (include "file:///external/config/some-config.edn")

## Continuous Integration Status

## Development

config uses [Leiningen
2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make
sure you have it installed and then run tests against supported
Clojure versions using

    lein all test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done
with your changes and all tests pass, submit a pull request on GitHub.
